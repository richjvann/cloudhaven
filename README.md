# CloudHaven

CloudHaven is open collaborative platform, with a common user-base, for dynamically building and hosting applications that are a composite of components from any organization.

The backbone of CloudHaven is an engine that dynamically renders Vue from a json-like text blob. This "json" defines the dataModel, lifecycle events, methods, computed, watches and filters; it can be used to define whole applications, components or mixins.

CloudHaven also features common messaging, workflow and calendar functionality with the unique feature that CloudHaven hosted applications can be seamlessly embedded directly in the content (message, task, event, respectively).
